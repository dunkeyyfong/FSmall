# FSmall

FSmall is a minimal web browser app inspired by [Min](https://minbrowser.org). Because Min is not supported on Mobile devices. I decided to create a similar app for mobile devices. I hope you like it :))).

FSmall have some features like:

- Full-text search for visited pages
- Automatic reader view for articles
- Dark mode

Download FSmall from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1560622823) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsmall). (Currently, it is only available for iOS and Android devices.)
